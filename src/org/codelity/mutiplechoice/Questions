10.The most commonly used ApplicationContext implementations are −

   FileSystemXmlApplicationContext −
   This container loads the definitions of the beans from an XML file. Here you need to provide the full path of the XML bean configuration file to the constructor.

   ClassPathXmlApplicationContext −
   This container loads the definitions of the beans from an XML file. Here you do not need to provide the full path of the XML file but you need to set CLASSPATH properly because this container will look like bean configuration XML file in CLASSPATH.

   WebXmlApplicationContext −
   This container loads the XML file with definitions of all beans from within a web application.

 19.What is the main difference between the Set and Bag collections in Hibernate? In what scenarios should we use Set and Bag?
 A <bag> is an unordered collection,
 which can contain duplicated elements.
 That means if you persist a bag with some order of elements,
 you cannot expect the same order retains when the collection is retrieved. There is not a “bag” concept in Java collections framework, so we just use a java.util.List corresponds to a <bag>.
 A <set> is similar to <bag> except that it can only store unique objects. That means no duplicate elements can be contained in a set.
 When you add the same element to a set for second time, it will replace the old one. A set is unordered by default but we can ask it to be sorted. The corresponding type of a in Java is java.util.Set.

 20.which is true
  a.bag has index column
  b. bag allows duplicates
  c. bag doesnt allow duplicates
  d. none of the above
  answer : c
